<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Day One</span> The Foot of a Wheel Stands Still</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Authors</span> This little book is about a great adventure we just had.</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Critic</span> I love adventure stories. What happened to you? Was it dangerous? Were you scared?</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Authors</span> (Blushing) Oh, well no, it wasn't that kind of adventure. Just an intellectual adventure. We've been inventing --</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Critic</span> (Disappointed) Well, cheer up. The world would never get along unless people invented new things. What did you invent?</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Authors</span> Well -- it wasn't really anything new. In fact it was invented before. We've been inventing the wheel.</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Critic</span> The Wheel! Did you say THE WHEEL? Ha-ha! Listen to that. These guys have been re-inventing the wheel. (Collapses in fits of laughter)</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Authors</span> Wouldn't you like us to tell you about it?</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Critic</span> You've got to be kidding. There can't be anything to tell. Everyone knows all about the wheel.</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Authors</span> (Plucking up courage) Well, Critic, could you explain how the wheel works?</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Critic</span> Of course I could! It's round and it rolls.</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Authors</span> O.K. Let's dig into it and you'll see what we mean. Let's imagine this old stone age guy pulling a big rock.</div>

</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Critic</span> He's having trouble.</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Authors</span> Well, if he only would invent the wheel he could put the rock on a cart and pull it along with the greatest of ease--</div>

<div class="illustration">
<img src="images/2-pulling-cart.svg" width="400px" alt="STONEY pulling a cart, whistling.">
</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Critic</span> Sure, everybody knows that. So what?</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Authors</span> Everyone knows <b>that</b> it works. But only a few people know <b>why</b> it works. Our adventure was in exploring all sides of why the wheel works and what people think about it. Most people think they understand it, but each one really only knows a piece of the story -- and hardly anyone knows the best parts.</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Critic</span> Tell me something I don't know about the wheel?</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Authors</span> Did it ever strike you that the wheel would help our stone age guy just by standing still?</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Critic</span> Of course not. A wheel does no good when it's standing still. I already told you, it helps him by <b>rolling</b>. By rolling, man, that's <b>moving</b>, not standing still.</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Authors</span> OK, the cart is moving forward. Sure, the wheel is turning. Of course, it's rolling. But the important thing is, <b>where the wheel is touching the ground, it is standing still</b>.</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Critic</span> Get out of here!</div>

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Authors</span> Cool it, Critic. We're going to do an EXPERIMENT.
<br>
Here's a wheel with three spots.<br>
A red triangle<br>
A green square<br>
A blue circle
</div>


<div class="illustration">
<canvas id="3-wheel-canvas" resize="true" alt="picture of wheel"></canvas>
</div>

We are going to roll the wheel a little. Watch the spots!

<div class="dialogue-line"><span class="speaker">Critic</span> That's amazing. The triangle moved a lot, the square a little, and the circle hardly at all! What's the trick?</div>
