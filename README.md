# Let's Reinvent The Wheel

An interactive retelling of "Let's Invent The Wheel" by Minsky and Papert.

AUTHORS: This little book is about a great adventure we just had.

CRITIC: I love adventure stories. What happened to you? Was it dangerous? Were you scared?

AUTHORS: (Blushing) Oh, well no, it wasn't that kind of adventure. Just an intellectual adventure. We've been inventing --

CRITIC: (Disappointed) Well, cheer up. The world would never get along unless people invented new things. What did you invent?

AUTHORS: Well -- it wasn't really anything new. In fact it was invented before. We've been inventing the wheel.
